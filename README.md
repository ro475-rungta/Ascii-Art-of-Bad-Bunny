# Ascii-Art-of-Bad-Bunny
This project demonstrates how an image can be transformed into ASCII art using Python. The main objective of this project is to convert a facial image of the artist Bad Bunny into a text-based visual representation made entirely of ASCII characters.

The program works by first loading the image and converting it into grayscale. Each pixel’s intensity value is then mapped to a corresponding ASCII character based on brightness levels. Darker pixels are represented by dense characters, while lighter pixels are represented by simpler characters. The final output visually resembles the original image but is displayed using only text symbols.

This project uses OpenCV for image processing and NumPy for efficient pixel manipulation. It helps in understanding basic concepts of image processing, grayscale conversion, pixel intensity mapping, and visual representation using text.

Overall, this project is a creative application of Python programming and computer vision techniques, making it suitable for students, beginners, and academic projects.
